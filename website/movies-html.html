                    <h3>Harry Potter</h3>
                    <div class="line2"></div>
                    <p> At first we see the mistreatment of an orphan boy by his despicable uncle, aunt and cousin. Then, on his 11th birthday, a lovable giant named Hagrid
                        bursts in with astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard and has a place at Hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardy. Harry is 
                        about to find out the truth about his parents and be exposed, along with us, to a whole new bewitching and enchanting world of adventures alongside his delightful friends Ron and Hermione.
                        Nothing can top the joy of watching this whole franchise for the first time. Each movie becomes darker and more serious, concluding with the epic battle
                        of Hogwarts.

                    <h3>Star Wars</h3>
                    <div class="line2"></div>
                    <p> A space battle of the good and the evil, with iconic characters, an outstanding soundtrack, sounds and effects.
                        Truly amazing and so advanced for the time it came out in. While I appreciate certain plot aspects of the prequel trilogy,
                        for me it can't compare to the original trilogy. As for the sequels trilogy, I thought
                        that they are pretty good movies, but as with every modern-remake, they can be too action packed to the point where it reduces to
                        you being confused what is the plot even about. I would reccommend the original trilogy to everyone and if they find it interesting,
                        they can check out the whole franchise.

                    <p class="txt">A subtle mockery on a society obsessed with their social status and what other people are up to & a 
                        beautiful love story. While the movie is a bit rushed and more scenes off the book could be covered, it's still a pretty good 
                        adaption, I love the witty dialogue, the cinemaptography is stunning and the actors have captured their characters accurately.

                    <p class="txt">A unique movie about the frustration of class differences, equally entertaining & disturbing. The plot is really clever and 
                        centers around Kim, a struggling family and Park, a wealthy family. Once the Kim's son is offered the chance to pose as 
                        a tutor for the daughter of the Park family, it paves the way for an insidous scheme,
                        and the stage seems set for a winner-takes-all class war.

                    <div class="line2"></div>
                    <p class="txt">The movie potrays the hardships of Elvis' career, as a 
                        naive and troubled man who allowed himself to be manipulated and completely fall apart. The cinematography is outstanding, it's flashy and 
                        colorful and fast-paced and just how I would imagine life in the 50's looked like.  Austin Butler's performance is insanely
                        accurate and amazing. </p>
