                    <p>Period dramas reflect a certain time period in history. 
                    </br>
                    Novels such as Pride & Prejudice, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights are among the most influental novels ever written
                    with such complex characters and a striking use of language that amaze the readers.
                </br> 
                    Pride & Prejudice is a more light-hearted book, where the emphasis is put on the love story between Darcy and Elizabeth,
                    where the revealing of their feelings for one another is postponed by his pride and her prejudice. Also the book is humorously subtly mocking
                    the society obsessed with social status and who marries whom.
            </br>
                    Jane Eyre follows Jane's journey from a troubled childhood to independence, and her turbulent romance
                    with the enigmatic Mr. Rochester who has a terrifying secret inside the gloomy Thornfield Hall.
        </br>
                    Wuthering Heights is simultaneously a beautiful, complex, dark, wicked novel.  All of the characters in
                    this book have their flaws highlighted, as Emily Bronte explores whether people
                    should really be classified as either good or bad according to society standards.
                </br>
                     The Great Gatsby potrays the Jazz era in America in the 1920s. While I didn't like the story that much, and certain parts felt
                     cryptic and foggy, I still think its label as one of the greatest modern classics is completely justified.
                     I could visualize the lavish parties, the luxury, and I especially liked the conclusion of the narrator Nick - "They were careless people, Tom and Daisy—they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness, or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they had made.”
                     and how he felt for the mistreatment of Gatsby: “They’re a rotten crowd’, I shouted across the lawn. ‘You’re worth the whole damn bunch put together.”
                     
            </br>
        </br>
                     I would reccomend these books to anyone as they are the pinnacle of the English literature.

                <h2>The Miserables</h2>
                <h4>by Victor Hugo</h4>
                <p>A historical novel displaying the injustices in France in the 19th century. One of the few books I had to read for school that stuck with me. There are perspectives of 5 characters, each having their own troubles in a society eager to make people suffer.</p>

                <h2>A Thousand Splendid Suns</h2>
                <h4>by Khaled Hosseini</h4>
                <p>A truly breathtaking and heart-wrenching book potraying the modern history in Afghanistan - that puts the violence of the Taliban,
                    the oppression and disenfranchisement of women, the tragedy of war, the fear, hope and faith of this country in human terms.

                <h2>The Picture of Dorian Gray</h2>
                <h4>by Oscar Wilde</h4>
                <p> It begins with a simple realisation, that Dorian's
                    beauty is finite. So by making a deal with the devil, Dorian has no consequences, age and all his sins
                     reflect on a painting of him and not himself. An amazing book with exquisite prose and allegory.

                <h2>The Gates of Evangeline</h2>
                <h4>by Hester Young</h4>
                <p>While I'm not the biggest fan of mysteries, this was a really great read with a plot twist I really didn't guess.
                    It's very fast paced but the story is not rushed, everything is clear and it has a supernatural element i.e.
                    the lead has dark visions helping her solve a decades-old case of a missing child.
